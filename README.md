Welcome to my GitHub repository for a Morse code palindrome checker! 🎉

This project aims to provide a simple tool that converts any given word into Morse code and checks whether the resulting sequence of dots and dashes is a palindrome(reads same forwards and backwards) or not. 🤔

the repository uses python programming language

The repository contains all the necessary files and instructions to run the program, so you can clone it and try it out for yourself! ⚙️

create a website where the user can:
1) hear and download the audio file of the outputted morse code
2) check if a morse output is palindrome or not
3) show the user the international morse code (ITU) output
4) edit the words that will be encoded to morse code
5) more requirements coming soon...
