# palindroomne-morse
Welcome to my GitHub repository for a Morse code palindrome checker! 🎉

This project aims to provide a simple tool that converts any given word into Morse code and checks whether the resulting sequence of dots and dashes is a palindrome or not. 🤔

Using Python programming language, this tool allows you to input any word or phrase and see if it reads the same forwards and backwards in Morse code. 🔍

The repository contains all the necessary files and instructions to run the program, so you can clone it and try it out for yourself! ⚙️

I hope you find this tool useful and interesting. Don't forget to leave a ⭐️ if you enjoy using it! 😊
